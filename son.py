# To integrate the above JavaScript code into a Streamlit web app, you can use the ‘Streamlit Components’ functionality . This allows you to create a bi-directional Streamlit Component with a frontend built out of HTML and any other web technology you like (JavaScript, React, Vue, etc.) and a Python API that Streamlit apps use to instantiate and talk to that frontend .

# Here is an example of how you can create a Streamlit Component that captures a photo using JavaScript and displays it in a Streamlit app:

import streamlit as st
import streamlit.components.v1 as components

def photo_capture():
    components.html("""
        <video id="video" width="640" height="480" autoplay></video>
    <script>
        navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })
            .then(stream => {
                const video = document.querySelector('video');
                video.srcObject = stream;
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error('Error accessing camera stream:', error);
            });
    </script>
    """)
